# Case Studies

Case studies capture real and hypothetical incidents where agentic development introduced failures that traditional review and testing did not prevent.

They exist to make ADG concrete: what drift looks like in the wild, how it propagates, and why “it passed CI” is not a safety argument.

## What belongs in a case study

Each case study SHOULD include:
- Summary (expanded narrative)
- Root Cause
- Tags (Industry / Pattern / Phase / Agent Type / Severity)
- ADG Prevention (which controls would have prevented or reduced impact)

## Where the “how to use” guidance lives

Operational guidance for using case studies in adoption programs lives in:
- **[Using Case Studies](/docs/framework/using-case-studies)**
