# Concepts

Agentic Development Governance (ADG) is the governance discipline for **building, changing, and shipping software with AI agents**—especially when humans cannot realistically audit every change an agent makes.

This section establishes the **definitions, mental models, and failure modes** that make ADG necessary.

## Start here

1. **[What is ADG?](/docs/concepts/what-is-adg)**
2. **[Canonical Definitions](/docs/concepts/definitions-agentic-development)**
3. **[ADG vs “AI Governance”](/docs/concepts/adg-vs-ai-governance)**
4. **[Failure Modes & Drift Taxonomy](/docs/concepts/failure-modes-drift-taxonomy)**
5. **[Case Studies](/docs/concepts/case-studies)**

## Boundary of this section

This section answers **WHAT and WHY**.

Implementation guidance (checklists, workflows, adoption playbooks) lives in **/docs/framework/**.
