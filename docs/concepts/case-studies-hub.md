# Case Studies Hub

This section collects real and hypothetical incidents where agentic development introduced failures that traditional review and testing did not prevent.

## How to use case studies
- Use them as **training artifacts** for teams adopting agentic development.
- Use them to identify which **ADG controls** you should implement first.
- Use them as inputs to your **risk model** (blast radius, reversibility, detectability).

## Case study format (standard)
Each case study SHOULD include:
- Summary (Expanded)
- Root Cause
- Tags (Industry / Pattern / Phase / Agent Type / Severity)
- ADG Prevention (which controls would have prevented or reduced impact)

## Next step
Create a `/docs/frameworks/case-studies/` directory and publish each case as its own `.md` file, then link them here.
