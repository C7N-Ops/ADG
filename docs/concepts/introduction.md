# Introduction to Agentic Development Governance

Welcome to the official documentation for **Agentic Development Governance (ADG)** - a comprehensive approach to managing and governing autonomous AI agents in software development workflows.

## What is ADG?

Agentic Development Governance (ADG) is a set of principles, standards, and frameworks designed to ensure that AI-powered development agents operate safely, transparently, and effectively within your software development lifecycle.

As AI agents become more capable of autonomous decision-making in development tasks, organizations need structured governance to:

- **Maintain oversight** of agent actions and decisions
- **Ensure compliance** with organizational policies and regulations
- **Preserve quality** in code and development artifacts
- **Enable collaboration** between human developers and AI agents

## Why ADG Matters

The rise of autonomous development agents presents both tremendous opportunities and significant challenges:

### Opportunities
- Accelerated development cycles
- Consistent code quality and standards
- 24/7 development capabilities
- Reduced cognitive load on human developers

### Challenges
- Accountability for agent decisions
- Security and access control
- Auditability and compliance
- Integration with existing workflows

ADG provides the governance structure to maximize benefits while mitigating risks.
