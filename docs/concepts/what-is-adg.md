# What is Agentic Development Governance?

Agentic Development Governance (ADG) is a systematic approach to governing autonomous AI agents that participate in software development activities.

## Definition

**Agentic Development Governance** encompasses the policies, processes, standards, and tools that organizations use to:

1. **Define** what autonomous agents can and cannot do
2. **Monitor** agent activities in real-time
3. **Audit** past agent actions for compliance and quality
4. **Control** agent permissions and access levels
5. **Integrate** agent workflows with human oversight

## The Agentic Development Landscape

Modern software development increasingly involves AI agents that can:

- Write and modify code autonomously
- Create and manage infrastructure
- Review and approve changes
- Deploy applications to production
- Respond to incidents and alerts

These capabilities require a new governance paradigm that goes beyond traditional access controls.

## Key Components of ADG

### 1. Policy Framework
Clear policies that define acceptable agent behaviors, boundaries, and escalation procedures.

### 2. Monitoring & Observability
Real-time visibility into agent actions, decisions, and their rationale.

### 3. Audit Trail
Comprehensive logging of all agent activities for compliance and forensic analysis.

### 4. Human Oversight Mechanisms
Defined checkpoints where human review and approval are required.

### 5. Risk Assessment
Continuous evaluation of risks associated with agent actions.

## ADG vs Traditional Governance

| Aspect | Traditional | ADG |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| Speed | Human-paced | Real-time |
| Volume | Limited by humans | High-throughput |
| Consistency | Variable | Highly consistent |
| Auditability | Manual | Automated |
| Adaptability | Slow to change | Dynamic policies |
