Welcome to **Agentic DevOps HQ**, the home of Agentic Development Governance (ADG).

As AI agents become increasingly capable of autonomous software development, the need for robust governance frameworks has never been more critical. ADG provides the standards, principles, and practical guidance organizations need to safely and effectively integrate autonomous agents into their development workflows.

## Why ADG?

The rise of AI-powered development agents presents both tremendous opportunities and significant challenges:

- **Opportunity**: Agents can dramatically accelerate development, improve consistency, and handle routine tasks autonomously.
- **Challenge**: Without proper governance, agent actions can introduce risks, compliance issues, and unpredictable outcomes.

ADG bridges this gap by providing:

1. **Clear Principles** - Foundational concepts for governing autonomous agents
2. **Formal Standards** - Specifications for behavior, oversight, and compliance
3. **Practical Framework** - Step-by-step guidance for implementation

## Getting Started

Whether you're just learning about agentic development or ready to implement governance in your organization, we have resources for you:

- Start with [ADG Concepts](/docs/concepts/introduction) to understand the fundamentals
- Review [ADG Standards](/docs/standards/overview) for formal specifications
- Use the [ADG Framework](/docs/framework/getting-started) for practical implementation

## Join the Community

ADG is an evolving discipline. We welcome contributions, feedback, and discussions from practitioners around the world. Together, we can build the governance frameworks that will shape the future of autonomous software development.

Stay tuned for more updates, case studies, and best practices!
