# Best Practices

Learn from the experience of organizations that have successfully implemented ADG.

## Governance Design

### Start Small, Iterate Fast

- Begin with one agent or team
- Learn from initial implementation
- Expand based on learnings
- Avoid big-bang rollouts

### Right-Size Governance

- Match governance intensity to risk
- Avoid over-governing low-risk actions
- Focus controls on high-impact decisions
- Review and adjust regularly

### Design for Failure

- Assume agents will make mistakes
- Build in safety nets and rollbacks
- Plan for edge cases
- Create clear incident response procedures

## Policy Management

### Keep Policies Simple

- Write clear, understandable policies
- Avoid overly complex rules
- Test policies before deployment
- Document policy intent and rationale

### Version Control Policies

- Treat policies as code
- Use version control
- Review policy changes
- Track policy history

### Regular Policy Review

- Schedule periodic reviews
- Incorporate incident learnings
- Adapt to new agent capabilities
- Remove obsolete policies

## Oversight Optimization

### Reduce Approval Fatigue

- Automate what can be automated
- Provide context for approvers
- Set appropriate timeout policies
- Measure approval cycle times

### Empower Reviewers

- Give approvers adequate information
- Provide clear decision criteria
- Enable easy approval/rejection
- Support conditional approvals

### Balance Speed and Safety

- Fast-track low-risk actions
- Add friction for high-risk actions
- Measure and optimize latency
- Continuously improve workflows

## Operational Excellence

### Comprehensive Logging

- Log more than you think you need
- Make logs searchable and queryable
- Plan for log analysis tooling
- Regularly validate log completeness

### Proactive Monitoring

- Don't wait for issues to be reported
- Use anomaly detection
- Create meaningful dashboards
- Set actionable alerts

### Continuous Improvement

- Track governance metrics
- Conduct regular retrospectives
- Share learnings across teams
- Celebrate governance successes

## Cultural Considerations

### Build Trust

- Be transparent about agent capabilities
- Explain governance decisions
- Address concerns openly
- Demonstrate value

### Foster Collaboration

- Include developers in governance design
- Seek feedback regularly
- Make governance a team effort
- Avoid us-vs-them dynamics

### Enable Innovation

- Don't let governance stifle experimentation
- Create safe spaces for new approaches
- Balance control with creativity
- Reward responsible innovation

## Common Pitfalls

### Avoid These Mistakes

1. **Over-engineering** - Starting with too complex a system
2. **Under-investing** - Not providing adequate resources
3. **Ignoring feedback** - Not listening to practitioners
4. **Static policies** - Not adapting to change
5. **Blame culture** - Focusing on punishment over learning
