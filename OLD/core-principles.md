# Core Principles of ADG

Agentic Development Governance is built on five foundational principles that guide all governance decisions and implementations.

## 1. Transparency

**All agent actions must be visible and explainable.**

- Agents must log all decisions and actions
- The reasoning behind agent decisions must be accessible
- Stakeholders can understand what agents did and why

### Implementation
- Structured logging of all agent activities
- Decision rationale capture
- Real-time dashboards and reporting

## 2. Accountability

**Clear ownership and responsibility for agent actions.**

- Every agent action must be traceable to responsible parties
- Humans remain ultimately accountable for agent outcomes
- Clear escalation paths for issues and incidents

### Implementation
- Agent identity and authentication
- Action attribution and ownership mapping
- Incident response procedures

## 3. Controllability

**Humans maintain meaningful control over agent behavior.**

- Ability to stop or pause agent actions at any time
- Configurable boundaries and limitations
- Override mechanisms for edge cases

### Implementation
- Kill switches and pause controls
- Policy-based boundaries
- Human-in-the-loop checkpoints

## 4. Compliance

**Agent behavior adheres to organizational and regulatory requirements.**

- Alignment with security policies
- Regulatory compliance (SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- Internal standards and best practices

### Implementation
- Automated compliance checks
- Policy enforcement engines
- Compliance reporting and auditing

## 5. Continuous Improvement

**Governance evolves with experience and changing needs.**

- Regular review and update of policies
- Learning from incidents and near-misses
- Adaptation to new agent capabilities

### Implementation
- Governance review cycles
- Feedback mechanisms
- Metrics and KPIs for governance effectiveness

## Balancing Principles

These principles sometimes create tension. For example:
- More control may reduce agent effectiveness
- Complete transparency may impact performance
- Strict compliance may limit innovation

ADG provides frameworks for balancing these trade-offs based on your organization's risk tolerance and objectives.
