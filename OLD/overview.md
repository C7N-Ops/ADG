# ADG Standards Overview

The ADG Standards provide formal specifications for implementing Agentic Development Governance in your organization.

## Purpose of ADG Standards

ADG Standards serve as:

- **Reference specifications** for governance implementations
- **Compliance benchmarks** for auditing agent behavior
- **Interoperability guidelines** for agent ecosystems
- **Best practice codification** from industry experience

## Standards Categories

### Behavioral Standards
Define how agents should behave in various contexts:
- Decision-making protocols
- Communication patterns
- Error handling procedures
- Resource utilization limits

### Oversight Standards
Specify human oversight requirements:
- Approval workflows
- Review checkpoints
- Escalation procedures
- Override mechanisms

### Compliance Standards
Establish audit and compliance frameworks:
- Logging requirements
- Retention policies
- Reporting formats
- Certification criteria

## Standards Levels

ADG Standards are organized into three compliance levels:

### Level 1: Foundation
Basic governance suitable for low-risk environments:
- Essential logging
- Basic access controls
- Minimal oversight requirements

### Level 2: Standard
Comprehensive governance for typical enterprise use:
- Full audit trails
- Policy enforcement
- Human-in-the-loop checkpoints
- Compliance reporting

### Level 3: Enhanced
Maximum governance for high-risk or regulated environments:
- Real-time monitoring
- Automated compliance checks
- Advanced analytics
- External audit support

## Adopting ADG Standards

1. **Assess** your current governance maturity
2. **Select** the appropriate standards level
3. **Plan** your implementation roadmap
4. **Implement** standards incrementally
5. **Validate** compliance continuously
6. **Evolve** as requirements change
